# Case Study: Differential Equations (MATH4827)

Developed and taught by John S Butler (TU Dublin)

## Description of Module
This is an introduction to the mathematics differential equations motivated by the Leaky Intergration and the Predator-prey model using python notebooks.

## Leaky Integration [1]
The Leaky Intergration differential equation describes how infromation is leaked over time.

## Predator Prey [2, 3, 4, 5]
The Predator-Prey model is a differential equation that describes the interaction between two or more species.
